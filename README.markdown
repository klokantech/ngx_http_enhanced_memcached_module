#Forked and patched enhanced memcached module

A small patch was needed because the nginx with enhanced memcached module normaly responses with new headers and content from the memcached, but we already have some headers in the memcached content. Documentation of this module says about adition "EXTRACT_HEADERS\r\n" to the first place in the memcached content and after this modification it should use headers from the content after content modification. But we don't want to change the iiif server in any way to change of the stored memcached content - so a small patch to always use the headers from the memcached content has been done.
